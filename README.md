# Small Pure-Javascript Projects

This is a collection of 20 small projects I coded to practic pure Javascript concepts. No frameworks were used, just plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## Projects

Here's a list of all the projects I coded for this challenge. You may see them all on this website I created to showcase them.

1. [Quote Generator](/quote-generator)\
    This is small app to fetch random quotes from an API via an async/wait function.\
    Demo: [Here](https://20-javascript-quote-generator.vercel.app) 

2. [Infinite Scroll](/infinite-scroll)\
    For this project, I added "infinite scroll" to display images fetched from the Unsplash API.\
    Demo: [Here](https://20-javascript-infinite-scroll.vercel.app) 
    
3. [Picture-in-Picture](/picture-in-picture)\
    An app to share any screen from your computer and play picture-in-picture mode.\
